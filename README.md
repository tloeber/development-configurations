# development-configurations
Single place to track important configurations for development. Also enables quick setup of new machines.

**Goal: Make it easy to adopt and follow proper engineering practices**.

This repo complements my [repo that documents the engineering standards to follow in order to create maintainable software](https://github.com/tloeber/engineering-standards). The core of this repo started as part of a more general [monorepo to track configs and utilities to manage my personal laptop using Infrastructure as Code principles](https://github.com/tloeber/utils_and_configs), but I eventually decided to split the more *general* processes for managing *personal* machines (e.g., backup and updating) from the setup of *development*-specific configurations.
